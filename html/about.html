        <h1>About BoomAPI</h1>
        BoomAPI aims to be the best source of Boom Arena statistics on the Internet. This project was started in order to provide real statistics to help the balance team, however it may also serve to help players find decks, or analyze their gameplay.<br>
        The BoomAPI source code, both <a href="https://github.com/silverslither/BoomAPI">backend</a> and <a href="https://github.com/silverslither/BoomAPI-GUI">frontend</a> are open-source on GitHub.
        <h2 style="margin-top: 8px;">How does it work?</h2>
        A server running 24/7 pretends to be a game client, and can then collect data from public replays. As a result of many games not being public, the server is unable to collect data from every game.
        <h2 style="margin-top: 8px;">I've discovered a bug on the website. How do I report it?</h2>
        Report bugs directly to me through direct messages (silverslither_ on Discord).
        <h2 style="margin-top: 8px;">I'm a developer. Can I use BoomAPI in my app?</h2>
        BoomAPI's endpoints are hosted on the api.boomapi.ca subdomain. Documentation will be available soon.
